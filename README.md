# Javed Khan – Live Resume

This repository contains my live, hosted DevOps resume built using pure HTML and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

This resume is not just a static document.

It reflects:
- My hands-on DevOps learning journey
- Production-style project building
- Continuous improvement through version control
- Public accountability for skill growth

Instead of sending PDFs, I maintain a live, version-controlled resume that evolves with my projects.

- Basic CSS (clean, minimal design)
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (hosting)
